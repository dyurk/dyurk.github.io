<h4>About the blog:</h4>
I've had the privilege of doing systems administration for quite some time now and I decided that it would be great to have a blog to share some tips, quick notes, wins and failures. Occasionally, there might be some rants and I might even go off topic, but I will try to add an educational value to each post. We should be learning something new each day!<em>  </em>
