When trying to switch user to apache and you get the following:Â "This account is currently not available". You need to set a shell for the apache user. Let's say we want to use bash.
<pre># chsh -s /bin/bash apache

</pre>
You should get this prompt:
<pre>Changing shell for apache.
Shell changed.</pre>
Done! Now you should be able to su as apache.
