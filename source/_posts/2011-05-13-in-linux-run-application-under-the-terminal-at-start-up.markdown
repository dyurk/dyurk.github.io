There are different ways to achieve this, but here is a simple way of doing it.

I created a new start up application under the Start Up Applications  Preferences, which is located under System&gt;Preferences&gt;Start Up  Applications.

Here is the command that I placed in the command box:
<pre>gnome-terminal -e "java -Djava.library.path=/usr/share/pcmonitor/lib/ -jar /usr/share/pcmonitor/bin/pcmonitor.jar -c /usr/share/pcmonitor/etc/pcmonitor.conf &amp;" &amp;</pre>
&nbsp;

For my particular case, I'm trying out Mobile Pc Monitor which requires  to run a .Jar file.Â  But any other applications/commands can be used.
<pre>gnome-terminal -e "COMMAND IN HERE" &amp;</pre>
