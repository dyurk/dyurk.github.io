  content: Awesome! This worked great! Thanks a lot. Just remember you also have to
    hit "extract all" on the downloaded folder because it's compressed.

    up to a router.


    I found the "Change Adapter Settings" option, and saw that the device was disabled,
    from there it would not enable even after restarting and taking it out and plugging
    it back in. I don''t know if there is something I missed but the instructions
    don''t tell me how to use it after the driver is hooked up...'

For some reason there are no 64bit drivers for the Linksys Wireless-G USB Network adapter. Well, there is a work around.

Download the following driver:

<a href="http://d87studios.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/WUSB54g_64x_Driver.zip">WUSB54g 64-bit Driver</a> [Zip]

<a href="http://www.ralinktech.com/en/04_support/license.php?sn=5012">Ralink Official Link</a> [exe]

In the Device Manager, Right-click on the Wireless USB Network Adatapter and select "Update Driver Software". Follow the instructions below:

<strong> Select to Browse my computer for driver</strong>
