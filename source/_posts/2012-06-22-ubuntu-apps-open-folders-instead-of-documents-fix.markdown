Recently after trying out Xfce I started to have issues with one of my go-to apps, Gnome Do. It would only open the directory of the file that i was trying to open. This also happen with Chrome, were downloaded files would not open, only their directory. The issue seems to be releated to some of the utilities that come with Xfec. This should do it:
<pre lang="shell" prompt="$">sudoÂ apt-get remove exo-utils</pre>
